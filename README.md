# Inventory Manager
> Tracks inventory whether it be for personal usage or in a warehouse.


This app is for our COMP380 class, Introduction to Software Engineering. After many proposals and planning, we decided this app would be the best to develop.



For warehouse usage, user can keep track of every thing within a warehouse or multiple. Each item comes equipped with a barcode and picture of the item.
_For more examples and usage, please refer to the [Wiki][wiki]._
